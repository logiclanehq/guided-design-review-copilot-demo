Design Review Report – Operational Analytics Platform

Review Summary:
The design presents a clear layered architecture aligned with common
enterprise analytics patterns. Overall readiness appears reasonable,
subject to clarification of identified gaps and risks.

Strengths:
- Clear separation of architectural concerns across layers
- Explicit consideration of non-functional requirements
- Logical end-to-end data ingestion and consumption flow

Gaps & Risks:
- Data retention and lifecycle management are not defined
- Trust boundaries between layers and external systems are unclear
- Failure handling and recovery strategies for batch processing are not described

Non-Functional Coverage Assessment:
Non-functional requirements are stated but lack detailed architectural
mechanisms demonstrating how they will be achieved.

Security & Risk Considerations:
RBAC and encryption are identified, but access models, key management,
and trust boundaries require further clarification.

LLD Alignment Observations:
No low-level design details were provided; alignment cannot be assessed.

Recommendations:
- Define data lifecycle, retention, and archival strategies
- Clarify security boundaries and access control models
- Document batch failure detection, retry, and recovery approaches

Open Questions:
- How are batch processing failures detected and remediated?
- What are the data retention and audit requirements?
